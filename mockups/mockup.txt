One of the key design ideas behind the mockups is a dual tablet plus paper system. It has the following reasons
    1. Subjectivity in doctors treatment.
    2. Usage of hand-drawn images on OPD card.
    3. Information entered is structured/semi-structured/unstructured. Not all data is stuctured.

Doctors enter all structured information 
    1. History + Symptoms (stored as concepts)
    2. Diagnosis and Treatment information (stored as concepts)
    3. Lab/Radiology Orders (stored as concepts)

Unstructured information may be added as notes.

All paper lab results and paper ECG/XRay reports etc to be scanned at the end of day by staff and uploaded into system.

The process of structuring the medical information present is a continuous and long one. Continuing with a paper + electronic
system will ensure less resistance and easy adoption of the system.
